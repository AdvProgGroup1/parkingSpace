Changes:

1. Login now integrated with Risdani's system.
2. The Login part which previousy made by JSP now in PHP.
3. Some features removed, such as "read username and password from file", "security login",
and "Security Check", due to time needed to changes everything from JSP-PHP.  

How to use:
1. Open tezt.php instead of tezt.html.
2. Login can be done with username "group1" and password "12345"
3. It will redirect to the booking page.
