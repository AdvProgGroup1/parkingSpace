Changes:

1. Login now integrated with Risdani's system in PHP version (JSP is not integrated yet).
2. Features included in JSP version such as "read username and password from file", "security login",
and "Security Check", are not included in this PHP version.  

How to use:
1. Open tezt.php instead of tezt.html.
2. Login can be done with username "group1" and password "12345"
3. It will redirect to the booking page.
